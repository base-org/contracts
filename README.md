# contracts

This repo contains contracts and scripts for Base.
Note that Base primarily utilizes Optimism's bedrock contracts located in Optimism's repo [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock).
For contract deployment artifacts, see [base-org/contract-deployments](https://github.com/base-org/contract-deployments).
